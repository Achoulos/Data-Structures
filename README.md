#Data Structures


A repository of various data structures and sorts, and others I have written in C.

I will continually update this as I implement more!

##Running the files

###Huffman Tree

To test the Huffman Tree generator, compile *huffman.c* and *tree.c* together. When running, pass in a *.txt* file as the sole argument, and the program will print out the optimal bit strings for compressing said .txt file!

###Radix Sort

To test Radix Sort, compile *deque.c* and *radix.c* together. Input the numbers you wish to sort, then simply input any character that is **not** a number to have the inputted numbers sorted and printed.
